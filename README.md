# fansapp
Simple CRUD-type app made in python, tkinter as GUI.

I made this app for an advanced python course at UTN Buenos Aires.

It lets you add, remove and edit football fans by club. Also shows a bar chart with number of fans by club when you hit the graph button.

Its built with an observer pattern that logs any access to the database, also has decorators that print info when this happens.

Used peewee as ORM.

For server usage, check VideoConsultaExterna.mkv

To init run controlador.py
